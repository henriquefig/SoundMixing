function [yb, Fs]=wah_wah(name)
% wah_wah.m   state variable band pass
%
% BP filter with narrow pass band, Fc oscillates up and
% down the spectrum
% Difference equation taken from DAFX chapter 2
%
% Changing this from a BP to a BR/BS (notch instead of a bandpass) converts
%  this effect to a phaser
%
% yl(n) = F1*yb(n) + yl(n-1)
% yb(n) = F1*yh(n) + yb(n-1)
% yh(n) = x(n) - yl(n-1) - Q1*yb(n-1)
